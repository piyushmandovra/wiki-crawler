Like other Lisps, Clojure treats code as data and has a macro system.[11] The current development process is community-driven,[12] overseen by Rich Hickey as its benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).[13]", :table-of-contents ("History and development process" "Design philosophy" "Features" "Platforms and popularity" "Examples" "See also" "References" "Further reading" "External links"), :links-to-follow ("/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English" "/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)")}
